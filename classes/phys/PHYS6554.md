## General Information
A continuation of PHYS 6553 and ASTRO 6509 that covers a variety of advanced topics and applications of general relativity in astrophysics, cosmology, and high-energy physics.


## Prerequisites

PHYS 6553 or permission of instructor.

## Topics Covered

  - Black hole thermodynamics
  - Other advanced topics in black hole physics such as rotation, perturbations, merger and ringdown, superradiance, singularity theorems, and properties of the horizon.
  - de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes
  - The mathematics of hypersurfaces and geodesic congruences
  - Energy and the Hamiltonian in GR

## Workload

  - 10 Problem sets ~5-15hours/week, and a final presentation. [Spring 2023]

## General Advice

Easier than the first general relativity course. [Spring 2023]

## Testimonials

Very fun; we covered Hawking radiation at the end, but the topics vary year to year. [Spring 2023]
