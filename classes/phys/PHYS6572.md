## General Information
4 credits
First part of the two-semester graduate quantum mechanics sequence. Covers non-relativistic quantum physics, focusing on fundamental conceptual issues and methods. Topics include: fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics using the Dirac notation, theory of angular momentum and spin, symmetries,  approximation methods and identical particles, at the level of Sakurai Modern Quantum Mechanics.

## Prerequisites

## Topics Covered

## Workload

- 10-15 hours/week, 1 Final [FA24]

## General Advice

- Fast-paced and rigorous. While the class syllabus pretty much follows Sakurai, the workload is high and the median grade is low. I would've taken 4443 as an undergraduate. [FA24]
