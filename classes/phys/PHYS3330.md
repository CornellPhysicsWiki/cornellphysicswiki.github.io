## General Information
A practical laboratory course in basic and modern optics. Students use lasers and basic optical bench equipment to cover a wide range of topics from geometrical optics to interference, diffraction, and polarization. Each experimental setup is equipped with standard, off-the-shelf optics and opto-mechanical components to provide the students with hands-on experience in practical laboratory techniques currently employed in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. Students are also introduced to digital imaging and image processing techniques. Five projects are prescribed and one last project is defined and designed by the student with help from the instructor. Each project will be documented in a professional laboratory notebook and a detailed scientific report. At the level of Optics by Hecht.
