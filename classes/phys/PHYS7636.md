## General Information

Continuation of PHYS 7635. The course is structured in two parts. The first half is on setting up the formalism and language of correlation function and responses that are used to define properties of phases. The second half is on applying the formalism to different symmetry broken phases (magnetism, superconductivity) and topological phases. The second half will also include topical subjects that are at the frontier of research.
