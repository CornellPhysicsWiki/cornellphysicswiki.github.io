## General Information

Introduction to the physics of crystalline solids. The majority of the course addresses the foundations of the subject, but time is devoted to modern and/or technologically important topics such as quantum size effects. At the level of Introduction to Solid State Physics by Kittel or Solid State Physics by Ashcroft and Mermin.

## Prerequisites

Highly recommended prerequisite: PHYS 4443, AEP 3620, or CHEM 7930.

## Topics Covered

  - Crystal structures
  - Diffraction
  - Electronic states and density functional theory
  - Lattice vibrations
  - Metals, insulators, and semiconductors
  - Optical properties
  - Magnetism
  - Superconductivity

## Workload



## General Advice

  - Make sure to review derivations and be sure you understand where material is developed from, assumptions, etc. [Fall 2023]

## Testimonials
Lectures can be pretty opaque and difficult to follow, but content is interesting and useful. Ashcroft and Mermin is tough to read. Homeworks are reasonable and help build understanding but can sometimes be tough. Rating 4/5 [Fall 2023]
