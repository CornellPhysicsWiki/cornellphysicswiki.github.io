## Workload

Weekly problem sets, two prelims, and a final exam. [Fall 2022]

Professor Fennie does not require homework to be turned in so, at least when I took it, the workload was very much dependent on how much time you wanted to put into the class. So, if you're confident with the material, the workload ends up being very light, but there are a lot of optional homeworks assigned so doing all of those would make the workload of the class more on par with other physics classes.
