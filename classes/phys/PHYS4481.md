## General Information

Hardware that exploits quantum phenomena can dramatically alter the nature of computation. Though constructing a general-purpose quantum computer remains a formidable technological challenge, there has been much recent experimental progress. In addition, the theory of quantum computation is of interest in itself, offering new perspectives on the nature of computation and information, as well as providing novel insights into the conceptual puzzles posed by quantum theory. This course is intended for physicists, unfamiliar with computational complexity theory or cryptography, and for computer scientists and mathematicians with prior exposure to quantum mechanics. 


## Prerequisites

Prerequisite: a prior course in quantum mechanics (such as PHYS 3316 or AEP 3610). Prior familiarity with group theory is very helpful.

## Topics Covered

  - Simple quantum algorithms
  - Error correction
  - Cryptography
  - Teleportation
  - uses of quantum computing devices either currently available or to be available in the near future

## Workload

- Homeworks are take some work but there are no prelims and only a final paper 

## General Advice

- Pay attention to lectures and do homework early

## Testimonials
The material isn't of much different quality than reading the textbooks are popular online notes on the topic but the homeworks were enjoyable. You go into both theory and application, Rating 4/5 [Fall 2022]
