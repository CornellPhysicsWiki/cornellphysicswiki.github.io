## General Information
Covers special relativity, Maxwell’s equations, electromagnetic potentials, conservation laws, Green’s functions, electromagnetic waves, dispersion, radiation theory, and scattering. The practical application of appropriate mathematical methods is emphasized. At the level of Classical Electrodynamics by Jackson.  

## Prerequisites

## Topics Covered

## Workload

We had a pset every two weeks, a 10-minute in-class quiz every two weeks, and a semester term paper. Total time dedicated per week was about 8-12 hours. [Fall 2023]

## General Advice

The class skims over topics from intermediate E&M, so don't expect to learn those topics thoroughly in this class.

## Testimonials

I enjoyed the class overall. We used Zangwill Modern Electrodynamics as the textbook, which was great for the first half but hard to follow for the 2nd half for the topics of wave guides and field relativity. Rating: 4/5. [Fall 2023]
