## General Information

Counts for the physics lab requirement. Crosslisted with AEP 3630.

## Prerequisites

E&M credit (PHYS 2208, PHYS 2213, or PHYS 2217)

## Topics Covered

- Resistors, capacitors, diodes
- Operational amplifiers
- Feedback amplifiers, oscillators, comparators
- Passive and active filters
- Transistor switches and amplifiers
- Combinational and sequential logic (gates, flipflops, registers, counters, timers)
- Analog to digital (ADC) and digital to analog (DAC) conversion
- Signal averaging
- Computer architecture and interfacing

## Workload

A lot. Two 3 hour labs per week, with lab report and one homework assignment due every week. One midterm and a final. 

## General Advice

The lab manuel knows all. The maneul is your go to guide for pretty much everything, and the problems at the end of each chapter are helpful for studying for the prelim. It is also helpful to read the chapter before going to lab. This is hard to get around to considering how much work the class already is, but you will be much more effecient during the lab period. 

## Testimonials
This class is quite infamous in the physics/AEP community here at Cornell. The 6hrs/week of lab are grueling, but it is usually straighforward and Kirkland and the TA are there to help. Following the manuel like  a "recipe" will get you an 85% on the labs. Doing the optional experiments and doing anything "extra" will get you some more points.
