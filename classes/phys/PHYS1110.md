## General Information
A lab course for all introductory physics students.  
Required as a corequisite for PHYS 1112 or PHYS 1116.  If you take either course without taking this one, you will be required to take this as a corequisite for PHYS 2213 or PHYS 2217.  

## Prerequisites
This class is intended as a corequisite for PHYS 1112 or PHYS 1116, so it effectively has the same prerequisites as either of those classes.  

## Topics Covered

## Workload
10 homework assignments over the course of the semester, each taking approximately 1 and a half hours. 1 lecture and 1 lab section per week. 3 quizzes with the 3rd one more like a final exam. [Fall 2022]

## General Advice
This class emphasizes ways of thinking in the lab, so during your lab sections, detail your lab notes with your thought processes and educated experimental decisions. [Fall 2022]
Do the most that you can in those 2 hour lab sections. They go by fast so make the most of the time available [Fall 2022]

## Testimonials
This class focuses on experimental procedures and, therefore, includes a good amount of statistics. Much of this content is subjective, so make sure to understand the reasoning and thought processes behind everything first. Lecture attendance is taken via PollEV participation. [Fall 2022]
