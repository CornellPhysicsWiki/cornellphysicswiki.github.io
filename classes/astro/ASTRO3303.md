## General Information

This course provides an overview of our current understanding of how galaxies have evolved over the last 13+ 
billion years and how their evolution has been influenced by their local intergalactic environment. We will 
look at the evidence that links supermassive black holes, gas accretion and merger events to galaxy evolution 
and track the star formation rate from early to current epochs. Additional topics will include the formation 
and distribution of clusters and groups of galaxies, the importance of dark matter and how galaxy evolution 
fits into the framework of current cosmological models.
