## General Information

 Astronomers learn about cosmic phenomena via radiation: electromagnetic (photons), non-photonic (neutrinos, cosmic rays), and, within the past decade, gravitational. So, it is essential to understand how radiation is produced, the interactions it experiences as it travels through the universe, and how these processes can be observed and interpreted. This course will provide a broad overview of primarily electromagnetic radiation, although we will briefly discuss other forms.
