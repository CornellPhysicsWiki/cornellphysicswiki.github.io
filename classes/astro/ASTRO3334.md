## General Information

Introduction to the tools of data processing and analysis for research in astronomy.  
The course reviews the techniques employed in astrophysical research, both observational and theoretical, 
to explore the universe.  Methods and strategies of data acquisition and image and signal processing are 
discussed. Students gain hands-on experience with visualization techniques and methods of error analysis, 
data fitting, numerical simulation, and data scalability.  Exercises address the processes by which astrophysicists 
piece together observations made with today's foremost astronomical instruments to solve questions concerning the 
origin of planets, stars, galaxies, and the universe itself.  This course prepares students with the techniques and 
computing tools necessary to undertake research in astronomy and other data-driven fields.
