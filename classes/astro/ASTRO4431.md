layout: post
---

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css">

## General Information

Major topics include: the structure and evolution of stars; solar neutrino astronomy; stellar seismology; the physics of white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes; the physics of low mass stars and connection to planets. Basic ideas in atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter physics, nuclear and particle physics, fluid mechanics and general relativity are introduced in a practical fashion that emphasizes concepts useful for understanding astrophysical phenomena.
## Prerequisites

Mathematics above 2000 level, physics above 3000 level. Recommended prerequisite: PHYS 4443.

## Topics Covered

- Observational overview for ordinary stars; the fundamental question of stellar astronomy
- Hydrostatic balance; simple solutions
- Energy transport in stars: radiative diffusion; convection
- Energy production in stars: H-burning and the main sequence; He burning
