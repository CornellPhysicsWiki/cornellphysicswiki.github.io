## Testimonials

I really enjoyed this class. Professor Ho is a very caring, engaging and passionate professor. What is amazing about this class is that it covers almost all the different fields in astronomy, which means you can get an overview of what astronomy is like. You will get to learn different fields in more detail when you take 3000 and 4000 level classes, but none with the range of knowledge as 2211.  [Fall 2024]
