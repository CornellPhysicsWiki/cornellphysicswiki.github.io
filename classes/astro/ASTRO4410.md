## General Information

The course covers methods in optical and radio astronomy and selected topics in astrophysics.

## Prerequisites

Priority given to Astro majors or Physics majors with Astro minors
PHYS 2214 or PHYS 2218, PHYS 3310 or PHYS 3360, PHYS 3327, or permission from instructor
Recommended prerequisite: ASTRO 3310 or ASTRO 3334

## Topics Covered

The course covers methods in optical and radio astronomy and selected topics in astrophysics. 
  - Astronomical instrumentation and data analysis applied to the following:
      - Asteroids
      - Main-sequence stars
      - Supernova remnants
      - Globular clusters
      - Planetary nebulae
      - Interstellar medium
      - OH masers
      - Galaxies
  - Statistical data analysis
  - Artifact and interference excision
  - Fourier transfrms
  - Heterodyned receivers
  - Software-defined radio

  - Techniques: charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging, optical photometry, optical spectroscopy, radiometry and radio spectroscopy
  - Fundamentals of astronomical instrumentation and data analysis applied to a wide range of celestial phenomena:
    asteroids, main-sequence stars, supernova remnants, globular clusters, planetary nebulae, the interstellar medium, OH masers, and galaxies
  - Methods: statistical data analysis, artifact, and interference excision, Fourier transforms, heterodyned receivers, and software-defined radio
Observations use the Hartung-Boothroyd Observatory's 24-inch telescope and a 3.8-meter radio telescope on the roof of the Space Sciences Building.

## Workload

Not too bad - 6 lab assignments and 2 more pset like assignments. Labs take a while like 10 hours a pop maybe. Also quizzes pretty often - maybe every 3 weeks. [Fall 2025]

## General Advice

  
## Testimonials

Some aspects of the course are a bit unclear and disorganized, but a good course on what is really involved in astro research! [Fall 2025]
