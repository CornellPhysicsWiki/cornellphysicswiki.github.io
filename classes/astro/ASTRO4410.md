## Topics Covered

The course covers methods in optical and radio astronomy and selected topics in astrophysics. 
  - Astronomical instrumentation and data analysis applied to the following:
      - Asteroids
      - Main-sequence stars
      - Supernova remnants
      - Globular clusters
      - Planetary nebulae
      - Interstellar medium
      - OH masers
      - Galaxies
  - Statistical data analysis
  - Artifact and interference excision
  - Fourier transfrms
  - Heterodyned receivers
  - Software-defined radio

  - Techniques: charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging, optical photometry, optical spectroscopy, radiometry and radio spectroscopy
  - Fundamentals of astronomical instrumentation and data analysis applied to a wide range of celestial phenomena:
    asteroids, main-sequence stars, supernova remnants, globular clusters, planetary nebulae, the interstellar medium, OH masers, and galaxies
  - Methods: statistical data analysis, artifact, and interference excision, Fourier transforms, heterodyned receivers, and software-defined radio
Observations use the Hartung-Boothroyd Observatory's 24-inch telescope and a 3.8-meter radio telescope on the roof of the Space Sciences Building.
