## General Information

Fall. 3 credits. Student option grading (no audit).

Introduction to Numerical computation (e.g., derivatives, integrals, differential equations, matrices, boundary-value problems, 
FFT’s, Monte Carlo methods) as applied to engineering physics problems that cannot be solved analytically (e.g., chaotic systems,
three-body problem, electrostatic fields, quantum energy levels).


## Prerequisites
  -  C/C++ computer programming required (some Matlab, Python, etc.). Some prior exposure to programming assumed but no previous experience with C/C++ assumed.
  - Prerequisites: AEP 3200, PHYS 2214 or PHYS 2218, CS 1110 or CS 1112, or equivalent, or permission of instructor. 
  - Corequisites: AEP 3330, AEP 3610, AEP 4200. Co-meets with AEP 5380.
