Prerequisite: AEP 3610 or PHYS 3316. Corequisite: AEP 4200 or permission of instructor. Co-meets with AEP 5620.

## Topics Covered

Topics include operator formalism and matrix representation,angular momentum and spin, the hydrogen atom, techniques for solving Schrodinger’s equation including perturbation theory, two- and three-level systems, interaction with radiation, and identical particles.


## Workload

The workload is standard for an AEP course. Many problem sets cover material that was covered during lecture making lecture very helpful. [Spring 2024]

## General Advice

  - The problem sets are a good representation of what may appear on exams. The course also uses PollEv questions and general topics covered in lecture to assess understanding. [Spring 2024]

## Testimonials

Professor Yasuda is super kind and helpful. He really tries to make sure you understand the material and wants everyone to succeed. [Spring 2024]
