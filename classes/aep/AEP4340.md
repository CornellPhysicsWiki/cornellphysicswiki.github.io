## General Information

4 credits course offered in spring. Student option grading.


## Prerequisites
- AEP 3330, AEP 4200, AEP 3550 or equivalent

## Topics Covered

Intro to elasticity (including stress and strain tensors and their linear relations for isotropic materials), 
very brief intro to plastic deformation, fluid properties and some hydrostatics, conservation laws with applications 
(including pipes), dimensional analysis, vorticity, ideal flow (including forms of Bernoulli equations and potential flow), 
flow past objects (including boundary layers, drag, lift, and model aerofoils), instabilities, a brief introduction to turbulence
(including Reynolds stress from time averaging), some topics in compressible flow (including choking and shock waves).

## Workload
  - One pset per week
  - Participation credit worksheet


## General Advice


## Testimonials
  - Overall, the content is very interesting and novel because the physics department does not emphasize content on fluid dynamics. [rate 4/5] [Spring 25]
