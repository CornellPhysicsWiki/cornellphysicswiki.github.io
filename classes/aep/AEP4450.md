## General Information

Spring. 3 credits. Student option grading. 

Introductory Senior-level course on electromagnetic and optical metamaterials. The properties of matter can be molded
and tailored on subwavelength spatial scales yielding ‘metamaterials’ with properties very different from naturally 
occurring materials, thereby opening up new directions for applications.

## Prerequisites
   - Prerequisite: ECE 3030 or AEP 3550, or permission of instructor. Co-meets with ECE 5380.


## Topics Covered

The course introduces the electromagnetic and optical properties of surface plasmons and polaritons, artificial magnetic 
materials, negative-index materials, nanostructured optical materials, etc. The course also discusses the applications of 
these materials in diverse areas including electromagnetic cloaking and invisibility, stealth technologies, optical super-lensing,
bio-chemical sensing, conformal optics, meta-surfaces, and non-reciprocal devices.
