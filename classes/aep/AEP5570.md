## General Information

Applied electrodynamics covers most of the material of chapters 5-14 of Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics text. The course uses the book Modern Electrodynamics by Zangwill (chapters 14-22). The pre-Maxwell equations are discussed with reference to slowly varying magnetic fields of conductors, skin depths, eddy currents, and magnetic diffusion. The Maxwell equations in vacuum are solved using Green’s functions which give the Lienard-Wiechert potentials and fields. Polarization of the EM wave is discussed including the Stokes parameters. EM waves in matter are discussed and the Kramers-Kronig relations are derived and the Drude model is discussed. Waveguides, optical fibers, and resonant cavities are investigated in detail, and the Telegrapher’s equations are derived and discussed. Radiation is treated starting with electric and magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole radiation using special relativity. Radiation of leptons in linear and circular accelerators is treated. Finally, Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction are discussed.
