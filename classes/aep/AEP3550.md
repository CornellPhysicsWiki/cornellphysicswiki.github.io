## Testimonials

This class is pretty chill, aside from the exams. The professor usually ends lecture early which is super nice and the homeworks are all textbook problems. A lot of the content is review from PHYS 2217 which is nice because you are already familiar with it. The exams are kind of unpredictable, sometimes the questions are on the easier side and sometimes the questions are very hard. Overall the class is taught well and follows the textbook closely. Rating: 4/5. [Spring 2024]
