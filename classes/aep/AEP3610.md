## General Information

Introductory course in quantum mechanics. Emphasis is on developing both an intuitive understanding of quantum mechanics and how to apply it rigorously.

## Prerequisites

PHYS 2214 or PHYS 2218, Corequisite: 4200

## Topics Covered

 - Schrodinger's equation
 - Statistical interpretation of the wavefunction
 - Potentials in 1 to 3 dimensions 
 - Dirac notation and Hilbert space
 - Ladder operators for harmonic potentials and angular momentum
 - Exact solutions for the hydrogen atom and spin systems


## Workload

Standard for an AEP course. Some problem sets take a long time and are computation heavy before doing things more qualitatively. [Fall 2023]

Not a lot, but many tedious calculations. [Fall 2023]

## General Advice

Take advantage of office hours. They are super helpful and Griffith's is a great textbook for this course. [Fall 2023]

## Testimonials

Professor Fuchs is great. He's super kind and very helpful during office hours. At the end of the day, he wants everyone to gain a strong understanding of the content. Rating: 5/5. [Fall 2023]

Very standard course. HW not very conceptual, more calculation-based. Rating: 3/5. [Fall 2023]
