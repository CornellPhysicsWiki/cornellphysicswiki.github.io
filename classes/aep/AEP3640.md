<link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css">

## General Information

A hands-on introduction to modern applied physics computer-aided experimental design with weekly laboratory-based problem solving 
culminating in the development and use of an automated laser scanning microscope system. Students learn fundamentals of the theory 
and practice of computer-aided control of equipment and data acquisition in an applied physics laboratory. This course means to introduce 
students to the practice of scientific and engineering R&D, which includes stages of design, experimentation, and the communication of
knowledge gained. Students will develop effective writing and communication skills both as a tool for practicing engineering design and
for the dissemination of knowledge through a formal article.

## Prerequisites

ENGRC 3640. No prior knowledge of LabVIEW is required; LabVIEW basics will be learned through weekly laboratory activities rather than 
by formal instruction.

## Topics Covered

  - Introductory optical microscopy
  - Analog-to-digital conversion and diital-to-analog conversion
  - Hardware timing
  - Error in digital systems
  - Discrete Fourier analysis and sampling theorem
  - Data analysis is performed primarily using MATLAB or Python and instrument interfacing is using LabVIEW and serial communication protocols
