<link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css">

## General Information

Introduction to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, the study of systems that do not obey a simplified linear form, in which their behavior can become hard to predict. Applications in physics, chemsitry, biology, and engineering, such as fluid flow, will also be explored.

## Prerequisites

The introductory math sequence class (MATH 2210-2220, MATH 2230-2240, or MATH 1920-2940) and familiarity with proofs (a 3000-level math class would be beneficial). MATH 2930 or equivalent preparation in differential equations. 

## Topics Covered

- One-dimensional systems 
- Bifurcations 
- Phase plane
- Nonlinear oscillators 
- Lorenz equations 
- Chaos
- Strange attractors
