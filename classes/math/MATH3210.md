## General Information

Fall offered only.

A manifold is a type of subset of Euclidean space that has a well-defined tangent space at every point. 
Such a set is amenable to the methods of multivariable calculus. After a review of some relevant calculus, 
this course investigates manifolds and the structures that they are endowed with.



## Prerequisites
- MATH 2210-MATH 2220, MATH 2230-MATH 2240, MATH 1920-MATH 2940, or equivalent

## Topics Covered
- manifolds and structures such as tangent vectors, boundaries, orientations, and differential forms.
- The notion of a differential form encompasses such ideas as area forms and volume forms, 
the work exerted by a force, the flow of a fluid, and the curvature of a surface, space or hyperspace.
- Re-examines the integral theorems of vector calculus (Green, Gauss and Stokes) in the light of differential forms and applies them to problems in partial 
differential equations, topology, fluid mechanics and electromagnetism.
