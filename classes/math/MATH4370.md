## General Information
Fall offered only. Introduction to algebraic geometry and computational algebra. In this course, students learn how to compute a Gr√∂bner basis for polynomials in many variables. 


## Prerequisites

- MATH 2210, MATH 2230, MATH 2940, or equivalent
- Students will be expected to be comfortable writing proofs
- More experience with proofs may be gained by first taking a 3000-level MATH course

## Topics Covered
Covers the following applications: 
- solving systems of polynomial equations in many variables
- solving diophantine equations in many variables, 3-colorable graphs
- integer programming

Such applications arise, for example, in computer science, engineering, economics, and physics.
