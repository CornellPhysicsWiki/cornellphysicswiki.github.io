## General Information
Introduction to linear algebra, including the study of vector spaces, linear transformations, matrices, and systems of linear equations. Additional topics include quadratic forms and inner product spaces, canonical forms for various classes of matrices and linear transformations. Students will be expected to be comfortable writing proofs. More experience with proofs may be gained by first taking a 3000-level MATH course. Undergraduates who plan to attend graduate school in mathematics should take MATH 4330 instead of MATH 4310. 

## Prerequisites
 MATH 2210, MATH 2230, MATH 2310, MATH 2940, or equivalent.

## Topics Covered


## Workload

Maybe 3 hours per week on homework. [Fall 2025]

## General Advice

- Great math class! Good, manageable workload. [Fall 2025]  

## Testimonials

- Starts with a lot of review of MATH 2210, and then gets into new content. Don't cover much directly applicable to physics, but it is a good and well organized class, at least under Prof Iorga! [Fall 2025]
