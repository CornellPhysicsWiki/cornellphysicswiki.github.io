## General Information

An introduction to the study of different types of matrices, such as orthogonal, unitary, or symplecti, a topic that is central to mathematics and important in physics and engineering. 

## Prerequisites

The introductory math sequence (MATH 2210-2220, MATH 2230-2240, or MATH 1920-2940), an additional 3000-level MATH class, familiarity with proofs, knowledge of programming (MATH 4250/CS 4210 and MATH 4260/CS 4220 are useful).
## Topics Covered

  - Error analysis
  - Approximation
  - Interpolation
  - Numerical integration
  - Building approximate solvers for ordinary and partial differential equations using the above techniques
  - Advantages, disadvantages, and limits of applicability for all the covered techniques
