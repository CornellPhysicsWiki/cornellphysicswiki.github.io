<link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css">

## General Information

Theoretical and rigorous introduction to complex variable theory.

## Prerequisites

  - MATH 2230-MATH 2240, MATH 3110, or MATH 4130, or permission of instructor.

  - Students will be expected to be comfortable writing proofs. Students interested in the applications of complex analysis should consider MATH 4220 rather than MATH 4180.
    However, undergraduates who plan to attend graduate school in mathematics should take MATH 4180.

## Topics Covered

  - Topics include complex numbers, differential and integral calculus for functions of a complex variable 
    including Cauchy's theorem and the calculus of residues, elements of conformal mapping.
