## General Information

Differential geometry involves using calculus to study geometric concepts such as curvature and geodesics. 
This introductory course focuses on the differential geometry of curves and surfaces. It may also touch upon 
the higher-dimensional generalizations, Riemannian manifolds, which underlie the study of general relativity.

## Prerequisites

MATH 2210-MATH 2220, MATH 2230-MATH 2240, MATH 1920-MATH 2940, or equivalent.

## Topics Covered
 
  
## Workload



## General Advice


Students will be expected to be comfortable writing proofs. More experience with proofs
may be gained by first taking a 3000-level MATH course. MATH 4530 is not a prerequisite.
