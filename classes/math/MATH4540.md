## General Information

Differential geometry involves using calculus to study geometric concepts such as curvature and geodesics. 
This introductory course focuses on the differential geometry of curves and surfaces. It may also touch upon 
the higher-dimensional generalizations, Riemannian manifolds, which underlie the study of general relativity.

## Prerequisites

MATH 2210-MATH 2220, MATH 2230-MATH 2240, MATH 1920-MATH 2940, or equivalent.
Students will be expected to be comfortable writing proofs. More experience with proofs
may be gained by first taking a 3000-level MATH course. MATH 4530 is not a prerequisite.

## Topics Covered
 
  
## Workload
One pset every 1 to 2 weeks. Pretty manageable. [Spring 2023]

## General Advice


## Testimonials
The class was well taught. Only goes up to R^3. Rating: 5/5. [Spring 2023]
