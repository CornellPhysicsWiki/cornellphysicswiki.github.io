  - Classification of second-order equations
  - Emphasis on maximum principles, existence, uniqueness, stability, Fourier series methods, approximation methods
  
## Workload

Homeworks every other week. About 15 hours to complete [Spring 2023]

## Testimonials

The class was very disorganized but Evans(the textbook) was very good to follow. The professor at the time was fast and was sometimes hard to keep up with but the material itself is well documented and explained in many textbooks. [Spring 2023]
