## General Information

One-semester introduction to general relativity that develops the essential structure and phenomenology of the theory without requiring prior exposure to tensor analysis. General relativity is a fundamental cornerstone of physics that underlies several of the most exciting areas of current research, including relativistic astrophysics, cosmology, and the search for a quantum theory of gravity. At the level of Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity by Hartle.

## Prerequisites

Classical mechanics at the level of PHYS 3318 and special relativity at the level of PHYS 1116 or PHYS 2216. Electromagnetism at the level of PHYS 3327 is useful.
