# Math Classes

All physics students are required to take an introductory sequence of math courses along with either the AEP mathematical physics sequence or MATH department courses that cover similar topics. On this page, we list the introductory math sequence along with some commonly taken upper-level math courses.

For students debating between the AEP mathematical physics sequence (AEP 3200 - AEP 4200) and MATH department courses, please refer to the [Mathematical Physics vs. Math Courses](/questions/FAQ/math_phys_vs_math.html) page.

## Intro sequence

The below math sequence is required for physics majors. Usually, many physics students have high school credit for MATH 1910, and these students begin their first semester with MATH 1920. It is extremely important to start this sequence in the first semester because all of the intro physics courses have one or more of these courses as a prerequisite. 

- [MATH 1910](/classes/math/MATH1910.html) - Calculus for Engineers
- [MATH 1920](/classes/math/MATH1920.html) - Multivariable Calculus for Engineers
- [MATH 2930](/classes/math/MATH2930.html) - Differential Equations for Engineers
- [MATH 2940](/classes/math/MATH2940.html) - Linear Algebra for Engineers

## Upper-level courses

As math is the language of physics, many physics students find it useful and interesting to also take upper-level math courses. To paint a picture of just how ubiquitous math is in physics, we have listed various subfields of math alongside some of their many (!) applications in physics.

| Math subfield                            | Physics applications                     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Analysis | Classical mechanics, E&M, fluid mechanics, biophysics, quantum mechanics |
| Algebra | Quantum mechanics, quantum computing, condensed matter physics |
| Geometry and topology | General relativity, quantum field theory |
| Probability and statistics | Experimental physics, statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics |

For more guidance on selecting math courses, you can consult the math department's [Life After Calculus](https://math.cornell.edu/life-after-calculus) and [Upper-Level Courses](https://math.cornell.edu/upper-level-courses) pages. These pages provide more details on what each of these subfields of math study.
