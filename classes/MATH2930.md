## General Information

A core mathematics course required for all physics majors, to be taken usually after MATH 1920, sometimes after MATH 2940.

## Prerequisites

MATH 1920

## Topics Covered

  - First order equations (separable, linear, homogeneous, exact)
  - Mathematical modeling (e.g., population growth, terminal velocity)
  - Qualitative methods (slope fields, phase plots, equilibria, and stability)
  - Numerical methods
  - Second-order equations (method of undetermined coefficients, application to oscillations and resonance, boundary-value problems and eigenvalues)
  - Fourier series
  - Partial differential equations (heat equation, wave equation, Laplace's equation)
