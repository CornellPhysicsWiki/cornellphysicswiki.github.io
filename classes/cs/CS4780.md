## General Information

A class that serves as an introduction to machine learning and focuses on supervised learning and the theary behind it. 

## Prerequisites

Discrete Structures (CS 2800)
A probability theory class (for example BTRY 3080, ECON 3130, MATH 4710, or ENGRD 2700) 
A linear algebra class (for example MATH 2940)

## Topics Covered

- Regularized linear models
- Boosting
- Kernels
- Deep networks
- Generative models
- Online learning
- Ethical questions arising in ML applications
  
## Workload

About 4 hours of work a week. Gets easier the more you know how to apply linear algebra in multivariate calculus. [Spring 2023]

## General Advice

Have a real reason to take it. [Spring 2023]
  
## Testimonials

Not very applicable to modern machine learning. Most useful thing is knowing how cost functions work. Probably better online classes for immediate application to physics. [Spring 2023]
