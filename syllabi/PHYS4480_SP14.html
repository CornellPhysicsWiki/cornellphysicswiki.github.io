Monday, Wednesday, Friday 12:20-1:10, Rockefeller 104<br>

<p>
This course teaches the theoretical underpinnings of the methods used by 
physicists and engineers in numerical computations. It follows closely the 
excellent text <strong>Numerical Recipes</strong>. We will cover roughly one
chapter per week, with one exercise per chapter, and some associated
group projects.

There are three main reasons that serious computational physicists and engineers
should know this material, even though computational environments like Octave,
Python, Matlab©, and Mathematica© provide "black-box" routines that
will reliably and efficiently perform many of these tasks. 
<ol>
<li>The black boxes often fail just where the physics is most interesting.
Knowing how they work is crucial for finding replacements.
</li><li>For computationally intensive tasks, one can often make use of
(or design new) specialized routines that outperform the general-purpose
routines.
</li><li>Amazingly often, researchers will use their knowledge of algorithms
to apply the basic ideas in a completely new context.
</li></ol>
We will deviate from the text in that we do <em>not</em> expect the students 
to program in C++ using the routines provided by Numerical Recipes. Rather,
we encourage them to make use of the same tools they intend to use in their
later research - either use one of the interactive computational
environments (Python, Octave, Matlab©, Mathematica©, R, ...) or
professionally written software libraries (GNU, Netlib, IMSL, NAG, ...).
A substantial portion of the course will be devoted to group projects.
