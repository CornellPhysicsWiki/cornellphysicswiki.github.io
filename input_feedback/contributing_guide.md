## How to Contribute

This site was started by students just like you, and we need your help in keeping it up-to-date and adding new content. If you want to update 
this website, you can either: 
- Edit the code directly, either on GitHub Desktop or with git
- Submit an issue ticket
- Fill out this [information form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3lDCHOlxUgBfDui19e5D3Wnydb42g-odYAOpfL27e9NFp4w/viewform?usp=sf_link) and a website admin will update the website content.

## Create an Issue Ticket

We always welcome new ideas, suggestions, and comments. You can add an issue ticket [here](https://github.com/CornellPhysicsWiki/cornellphysicswiki.github.io/issues). You will need to create a GitHub account to make an issue ticket.

## Edit the Website Code with Github Desktop

You can edit the website directly following these steps:

- Create a GitHub account
- Edit the website content directly on GitHub Desktop
- Submit a pull request

### 1. Create a GitHub account

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up. You’ll need to confirm your email address before you can do anything else.

### 2. Edit the website content directly on GitHub Desktop

Git can be a bit intimidating to learn for complete beginners. We do explain [how to edit the website with git](https://cornellphysicswiki.github.io/contributing_guide.html#edit-the-website-code-with-git) below. An advantage of this is that you can render your changes locally before submitting a pull request. However, it is also very easy to edit the website source code using GitHub Desktop. Just [visit our repository](https://github.com/CornellPhysicsWiki/cornellphysicswiki.github.io) and find the page you want to edit. Then hit the edit button! As an example, we will edit the PHYS 1116 class page. Towards the top of the picture below, `cornellphysicswiki.github.io/classes/PHYS1116.md` shows the directory of the file we are editing. We click the pencil icon (in the red box) to edit the page.

<img src="/imgs/edit_page.png">

After you click the pencil icon, you should see the the Markdown source code for the website. Markdown is a simple tool for adding formatting to plain text documents. A quick guide to the syntax can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). It is intended to be simple to use and easy to read.

There’s also some Markdown formatting specific to the software we’re using for this wiki, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). In particular, you might notice a section like this at the top of every page:

```
---
title: PHYS 1116 - Mechanics and Special Relativity
layout: post
---
```

This is just metadata that tells Jekyll what page template to use and what the page title is. You may also see:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css">
```

This links a CSS file that helps format the website. You should not edit or delete either of these parts above. Feel free to add/edit any content below these.

**Uploading Files**

If you want to add a new file, such as a class syllabus, navigate to the relevant folder. Towards the top right of the page, there is a box that says `Add file` with a dropdown menu. Click on `Upload files`.

<img src="/imgs/upload_file.png">

You should then be redirected to a new page where you can upload your file. Please be sure to look for and read the README.md files for further instructions on how to name files. Follow the instructions below for committing your uploaded files and edits to the website source code.

**Adding New Course Pages**

If you notice that a physics or physics-related class is missing from this wiki, we would appreciate you adding a new course page and adding some information! To do this, first go to the code for this [default class page](https://github.com/CornellPhysicsWiki/cornellphysicswiki.github.io/blob/master/default_class_page.md) and click "Copy raw contents".

<img src="/imgs/copy_default_class.png">

Navigate to the [classes folder](https://github.com/CornellPhysicsWiki/cornellphysicswiki.github.io/tree/master/classes) on the GitHub repository. In the top right, click "Add file" and "Create new file". You should be redirected to a new page, where you can paste the raw contents of the default class page. Set the name of the file to be: `[Four letters of course name][Four numbers of course name].md`, for example, `PHYS2218.md`. Edit the content of the page and add information. Don't forget to change the "Class Name" in:

```
---
title: Class Name
layout: post
---
```

<img src="/imgs/create_new_class.png">

Follow the instructions below for creating a pull request to add this class file to the website.

Once you have made the pull request, go back to the [home page of the wiki](https://github.com/CornellPhysicsWiki/cornellphysicswiki.github.io/blob/master/index.markdown). Edit the homepage and add a link to the class page you just created in the appropriate section by typing:

```
- [COURSE NAME](/classes/[name of the course page file you just made].html)
```

Create another pull request for this edit to the homepage.

### 3. Submit a pull request

Now let's suppose I have added some general information to the PHYS 1116 page and I want to submit these changes. The way to do this is to create a pull request. Scroll to the bottom of the page you have edited. There should be a box that says `Commit Changes`. Below that, select the option `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request`. A new text box should appear that allows you to name your new branch. Don't worry too much about how branches and version control in GitHub work for now. Write a short name for your branch that relates to the changes you have made. 

<img src="/imgs/make_pr.png">

Click `Propose Changes`. After that, you should be redirected to a new page like the one below:

<img src="/imgs/pull_request_3.png">

Enter some comments about your changes so that the website 
administrators/reviewer knows what changes you made. On the right, you will need to add at least one reviewer. This reviewer must be a website administrator and can be any of the people in the [CornellPhysicsWiki](https://github.com/orgs/CornellPhysicsWiki/people) page.

Click "Create Pull Request". You're reviewer might suggest some edits to your changes. Once your changes are approved, the website will be updated. Most of the time, as soon as we get around to reviewing your changes, we’ll just accept them.

Congratulations, you’re a contributor! If you’ve never done this before, then even better—you’ve just made your first contribution to open source.

If you want to add yourself to the contributors list, feel free to edit the file `contributors.md` and add your name.


## Edit the Website Code with Git

You can edit the website directly following these steps:

- Create a GitHub account
- Clone the repository on your local computer
- Create a new branch off of master
- Make your changes
- Submit a pull request

### 1. Create a GitHub account

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up. You’ll need to confirm your email address before you can do anything else.

### 2. Clone the repository on your local computer

There are two ways to make changes: you can either make a local copy of the codebase on your computer and edit it, or you can edit the code on the Desktop
version of GitHub. Here, we will discuss the first method. This method especially useful since it allows you to run your changes locally and test that everything
works before attempting to push your changes to the public website.

On your computer, open a terminal and go to the folder where you want to store the website files using `cd` commands.

Go the website [Github repository](https://github.com/CornellPhysicsWiki/cornellphysicswiki.github.io). Click the "Code" button at the top right. There 
should be a small pop-up window that says "Clone" and a URL, as shown below. Copy this URL and go back to your terminal. Enter `git clone [URL]`.

<img src="/imgs/clone_repo.png">

Now a copy of all the website files should be downloaded onto your computer!

### 3. Create a new branch off of master

The files for the public-facing website are all on a branch called `master`. Only the website administrators can directly edit the website on the master branch.
If you are not an administrator, then you will have to make your changes on a separate branch and request to merge your changes into `master`.

Making a new branch is especially easy on the Desktop version of GitHub. Go back to the website [Github repository](https://github.com/CornellPhysicsWiki/cornellphysicswiki.github.io). On the top left, there should be a gray box that says `master`. Click on this, and in the text box below, type what you want
to name your new branch. Make sure that no other existing branch has this name. After that, an option should show up saying `Create branch: [your branch] from master`. Click on this, and you will have created a branch where you can make all your changes!

<img src="/imgs/make_branch.png">

Now you will need to switch to your new branch on your local computer, so that all your changes will be stored there instead of `master`. In your terminal, enter:<br/>
`git pull`<br/>
`git checkout [your branch]`

### 4. Make your changes

Now that you are pretty much all set up, you can start making your changes! You can use any code editor you like, such as Visual Studio Code. The website pages are written using Markdown. Markdown is a simple tool for adding formatting to plain text documents. A quick guide to the syntax can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). It is intended to be simple to use and easy to read.

There’s also some Markdown formatting specific to the software we’re using for this wiki, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). In particular, you might notice a section like this at the top of every page:

```
---
title: PHYS 1116 - Mechanics and Special Relativity
layout: post
---
```

This is just metadata that tells Jekyll what page template to use and what the page title is.

After you make your changes, you may want to run the website locally to see if everything works. The website is built with a software called Jekyll, so if you clone the repository and try to preview, you’ll just get an preview of the markdown. Here’s how to fix this.

- [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#guides) on your computer.
- `cd` (the command) into the directory where you cloned the github repo.
- If jekyll is installed correctly, when you run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve`, you should see a serving running message. 
- Navigate to the server address in your browser (normally “127.0.0.1:4000”). You should see the page rendered.

### 5. Submit a pull request

You've created some amazing new pages and changes, and now you want to add them to the public wiki website! The way GitHub does this is through pull requests, where you merge all the changes on your new branch into `master`. First, you will need to commit your changes to your branch. In your terminal:

- Go to the folder where all the website files are store using `cd` commands
- Check that all the files you edited have been saved
- Enter `git add -A`
- Enter `git commit -m [summary of your changes in a few words]`
- Enter `git push`

Go to the [pull requests section](https://github.com/CornellPhysicsWiki/cornellphysicswiki.github.io/pulls) of the code repository and click "New Pull Request"

<img src="/imgs/pull_request_1.png">

There should be a gray box that says "Compare: [your branch]". If it doesn't say your branch name, then make sure to change it before making your pull request.

<img src="/imgs/pull_request_2.png">

Click "Create pull request". You should be redirected to a new page similar to the one below.

<img src="/imgs/pull_request_3.png">

Enter some comments about your changes so that the website 
administrators/reviewer knows what changes you made. On the right, you will need to add at least one reviewer. This reviewer must be a website administrator and can be any of the people below:

- Fatima Yousuf (fatimayousuf)
- Colin Murphy (colincmurphy)
- Ved Sriraman (sriramanved)
- Ariel Marxena (arixena24)
- Stella Dang (stelladang)
- Devisree Tallapaneni (devisreet)

Click "Create Pull Request". You're reviewer might suggest some edits to your changes. Once your changes are approved, the website will be updated. Most of the time, as soon as we get around to reviewing your changes, we’ll just accept them.

Congratulations, you’re a contributor! If you’ve never done this before, then even better—you’ve just made your first contribution to open source.

If you want to add yourself to the contributors list, feel free to edit the file `contributors.md` and add your name.
