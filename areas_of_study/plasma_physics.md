# Plasma, fusion physics

Plasma physics is an exciting and dynamic field of scientific exploration that delves into the intricate properties and behavior of plasmas. 
Plasmas, characterized by their electrically charged particles and high-energy states, exist in a wide range of natural and man-made environments, 
from the searing temperatures of stars to the controlled confines of laboratory experiments. At Cornell, plasma physics and fusion research is mostly done in the AEP department. The [Cornell Labratory of Plasma Studies](https://www.lps.cornell.edu/) carries out the majority of this research and has many professoers from AEP and other Engineering diciplines.

Below, you will find opportunities in departments such as Physics and Applied & Engineering Physics.
