# Astrophysics, General Relativity and Cosmology

Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena. Faculty at Cornell explore a wide variety of phenomena through theory, analysis and the development of new experimental/observational techniques, including: neutron stars, black holes, gravitational waves, dark matter, dark energy, the cosmic microwave background and inflation in the early universe.

Not only does astrophysics involve a high level of physics knowledge, it is also interdisciplinary. From experimental astronomy to theoretical cosmology, a highly specialized skill set is practiced in research.

## Research

Astrophysics theory is researched in the labs listed in these pages:
- [Astrophysics, General Relativity and Cosmology](https://physics.cornell.edu/research/astrophysics-general-relativity-and-cosmology)
- [Black Holes and Neutron Stars](https://astro.cornell.edu/research/black-holes-and-neutron-stars)
- [Cosmology and the Distant Universe](https://astro.cornell.edu/research/cosmology-and-distant-universe)
