# High-energy physics
Particle physics or high-energy physics is the study of fundamental particles and forces that constitute matter and radiation. The field also studies combinations of elementary particles up to the scale of protons and neutrons, while the study of combinations of protons and neutrons is called nuclear physics.

All high-energy physics is divided into two parts, one of which is concerned with the observation of physical phenomena and experiments, and the other with mathematical models and abstractions of physical phenomena. These sub-categories are examined below.

## Experimental high-energy physics
Cornell’s particle physicists are involved with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the International Linear Collider (ILC) and the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR). More resources can be found below:
- [Experimental Elementary Particle Physics](https://physics.cornell.edu/research/experimental-elementary-particle-physics)
- [Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-based ScienceS and Education (CLASSE)](https://www.classe.cornell.edu/)
  - [Undergraduate research opportunities](https://www.classe.cornell.edu/opportunities/students/undergraduate-research), listed under classe
- [Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS)](https://www.chess.cornell.edu/)
  - Note that SPS offers tours at Wilson Synchrotron Laboratory on a semesterly to yearly basis, so be on the lookout for these emails if you are interested
- [CLASSE Tours](https://tours.classe.cornell.edu/)
- [CLASSE Journal Club](https://www.classe.cornell.edu/NewsAndEvents/)

- [PHYS 7651](https://cornellphysicswiki.github.io/classes/phys/PHYS7651.html) Relativistic Quantum Field Theory I

## Theoretical high-energy physics
Theoretical high-energy physics is again divided into phenomenology and formal theory. The former is the application of theoretical physics to experimental data by making quantitative predictions based upon known theories, often working on interpreting the LHC data, while the latter doesn't. While the work done and central themes in respective disciplines are different, theory students learn the same theory through graduate classes, before receiving specialized education, supervised by their professor. More resources for an advanced undergraduate student can be found below:

Per the physics yellow book, the following courses are strongly recommended for research in theoretical high-energy physics:
- [PHYS 6553](https://cornellphysicswiki.github.io/classes/phys/PHYS6553.html) + [PHYS 6554](https://cornellphysicswiki.github.io/classes/phys/PHYS6554.html) - General Relativity I + II
- [PHYS 7651](https://cornellphysicswiki.github.io/classes/phys/PHYS7651.html) + [PHYS 7652](https://cornellphysicswiki.github.io/classes/phys/PHYS7652.html) - Relativistic Quantum Field Theory I + II
- [PHYS 6599](https://cornellphysicswiki.github.io/classes/phys/PHYS6599.html) - Cosmology
- [PHYS 7645](https://cornellphysicswiki.github.io/classes/phys/PHYS7645.html) - An Introduction to the Standard Model of Particle Physics

The following courses may be relevant to research in theoretical high-energy physics:
- MATH 6510 - Algebraic Topology
- MATH 6520 - Differentiable Manifolds

Seminar class on theoretical high-energy physics are sometimes offered, based on student interest. Some previously-offered topics are:
- The AdS/CFT Correspondence (FA25)
- String Theory (FA24, FA17)
- Relativistic Quantum Field Theory III (SP24, FA17)
- Black holes and Quantum Information (FA21)

## Accelerator physics
Accelerator physics is a branch of applied physics, concerned with designing, building and operating particle accelerators. As such, it can be described as the study of motion, manipulation and observation of relativistic charged particle beams and their interaction with accelerator structures by electromagnetic fields. 

Faculty at Cornell are involved in a broad range of topics in accelerator science and technology, from the operation of the on-campus Cornell Electron Storage Ring, also known as CESR, to the construction of an innovative new x-ray light source and the design and construction of future high energy colliders.
