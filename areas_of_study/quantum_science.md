# Quantum information science, quantum materials, optics, lasers

Quantum information science is a field that leverages the use of quantum mechanics in the manipulation and processing of information. By exploiting the unique nature of quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement, tasks are able to be performed far more efficiently than would be possible with classical computing. 

Below, you will find opportunities in departments such as Physics and Applied & Engineering Physics.
