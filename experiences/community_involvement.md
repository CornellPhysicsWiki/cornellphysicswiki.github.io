# Service, Outreach, and Community

The benefits of physics outreach are unbound. Outreach enriches the physics community here at Cornell and in the Ithaca area, and improves your science communication skills.
## Outreach and Service Opportunities

- [EYES](https://sites.google.com/site/cornelleyes/)
- [Splash!](https://cornell.learningu.org)
- [Cornell Physics UTA Program](https://physics.cornell.edu/undergraduate-teaching-assistant-program)   
  - Great program and introduction to teaching. Highly reccomend if you want to solidfy your understanding of physics or if you're interested in TAing in the future.
- [Cornell Learning Strategies Center (LSC) Tutoring](https://lsc.cornell.edu)
  - Free tutoring for the introduction physics sequence!
- [PhysTech - Physics Teacher Education Coalition](http://phystec.physics.cornell.edu)
- [The Ithaca Physics Bus](https://freescienceworkshop.org/physicsbus/) – The physics bus aims to awaken science and physics curiosity in young schoolchildren. SPS members are free to volunteer in local initiatives, but also to travel further away in country-wide trips!
