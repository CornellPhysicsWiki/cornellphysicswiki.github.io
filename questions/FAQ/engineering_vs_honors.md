For your first few semesters as a physics major, you will be taking an introductory sequence of courses that broadly covers: mechanics, special relativity, electricity, magnetism, waves, optics, and thermodynamics. There are generally two options that physics majors choose between:

**Option 1 (the honors sequence):** [PHYS 1116](/classes/PHYS1116.html), [PHYS 2217](/classes/PHYS2217.html), [PHYS 2218](/classes/PHYS2218.html)<br/>
**Option 2 (the engineering sequence):** [PHYS 1112](/classes/PHYS1112.html), [PHYS 2216](/classes/PHYS2216.html), [PHYS 2213](/classes/PHYS2213.html), [PHYS 2214](/classes/PHYS2214.html)

It is a difficult to answer whether or not you should take the engineering or honors sequence, since it depends largely on what your goals, priorities, and previous preparation are. Also, no one has fully completed both the engineering and the honors physics sequence. Moreover, experiences in certain courses can vary as professors and curricula change. However there are certain considerations to keep in mind when choosing between the two.

- The general wisdom is that if you are strongly considering attending graduate school in physics, then it is recommended to take the honors sequence. The level of mathematical rigor will be difficult at first, but it will prepare you better for upper-level courses in the physics major and future graduate studies. 
- That said, it absolutely is possible to take the engineering sequence and get into a good graduate program. If, going into the introductory sequence, you feel that your mathematical and physics background isn't quite strong enough to take the honors sequence, then it is worth considering taking the engineering sequence.
- If you were to take the engineering sequence, then you would have to learn mechanics and special relativity in two separate classes. In the honors sequence, these topics are both taught in PHYS 1116. Splitting the coursework across two classes and/or semesters may make things more manageable, although it will also take more time overall.
- The honors sequence classes are much more work than the engineering sequence classes, despite being the same number of credits. Problem sets in the honors sequence are more difficult and time-consuming. 
- It is possible to switch between the sequences. For example, you can take PHYS 1116 one semester and PHYS 2213 the next. "Dropping down" from an honors sequence class to an engineering sequence class is fairly easy. Going from an engineering sequence class to an honors sequence class may take a bit of catch-up.
- Although the honors sequence classes are more difficult, professors for honors classes usually take this into account and curve a bit upwards. The point is to not "punish" you for picking the more intensive class.
- Taking the honors sequence does not in any way make a person a "better" physics major. Physics is a difficult field that takes a lot of time and commitment to fully understand, regardless of whichever sequence you take. A good physics major is someone who is excited to develop strong problem-solving and critical thinking skills. There are many different paths to achieve this end, and the introductory sequence will not define the rest of your physics or educational career.
