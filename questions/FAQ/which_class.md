### Core Requirements

Here are the core requirements for the physics major:

### Concentration Requirements

In addition to the core requirements, every physics major must complete a concentration. You can choose to do either an inner concentration within the physics department, or you can choose to do a concentration in any other field of your choosing. Below is more information on concentration requirements.

### Sample Schedules

Here are some sample 4-year schedules for the physics major based on your level of high school preparation:

Some additional notes:
- We definitely recommend that you take introductory CS classes such as CS 1110 and/or CS 2110 in addition to your physics classes. If you want to get involved in research, knowing how to code will definitely come in handy. Upper-level physics labs may also require some basic coding skills. 
- It is also common for people with high school calculus and physics preparation to take PHYS 3316 and PHYS 3318 in the same semester.
- Students without a background in physics or calculus are usually advised to choose the outside concentration in order to more easily complete the major requirements within 8 semesters. This is definitely not a hard requirement - you can also do an inside concentration if you wish.
- This sample schedule is only a recommendation. You are free to switch up the order of classes so long as you still fulfill the required prerequisites.
- Even if you have high school physics AP credit, it is still suggested you take the entire introductory physics sequence. The physics introductory sequence at Cornell is much more rigorous than what is typically taught in high schools (especially the honors sequence).
- It is highly recommended that you use your high school Calculus AP credit to place out of math classes such as MATH 1910.
