## Advice for undergrads interested in doing theory in grad school
### Question
What would you generally recommend students interested in theory do in undergraduate, to prepare best for the ultracompetitive theory graduate school admissions? Most students will not be able to even remotely get involved in High Energy theory/Cosmology until third year with advanced mechanics and quantum. Even then, most topics in modern HEP/Cosmo are locked behind GR and QFT, and potentially even String Theory which are not really taught in most undergraduate institutions bar the occasional Intro relativity class. What are some topics of theory research more accessible to undergraduates in this vein. Would participating in experimental HEP or observational cosmology provide similar benefits as compared to directly theory and should this be done? Would graduate schools be willing to take a theory student with almost no theory research in undergraduate and instead with experimental particle research or observational cosmology? Thanking you in advance and would greatly appreciate any advice.

### Answer
"In general, students interested in theory should take advanced physics courses, and preferably some math courses too, and do well in them. Ideally, they should also try to participate in some theory research during undergrad in order to get a taste of what they are signing themselves up for. At Cornell, this often translates to students taking QM earlier on so that they are prepared for QFT by their junior/senior year. GR is another course commonly taken by prospective theorists, and some students are ready to tackle it by their sophomore/junior year. Regardless of when you learn these subjects, make sure you are adequately prepared—the professors will not hold back on content and workload. As for more specialized courses like String Theory and QFT III, you do not need to worry about them unless your PI recommends you take them (and at Cornell, they are not always offered anyway). Besides, many theory projects begin with literature reviews, so you will learn the requisite material one way or another.

Now, what should a student who has not yet taken QFT/GR do in the meantime? The most common route is to participate in experimental research. This can be beneficial for surveying and contextualizing a research area to better appreciate the many different flavors of work being done; any good theorist should be aware of the experimental developments in their field. There is the possibility that you even will enjoy experimental work—you won’t know unless you try. It could also give you an opportunity early on to make significant research contributions and perhaps produce publishable work. That being said, knowledge gained from these labs will likely not directly translate to theoretical work, especially if you are doing a project that is very hands-on like building a telescope or some part of a particle accelerator.

Sometimes, knowledge of QM is sufficient to join some phenomenological particle physics and condensed matter theory groups. You may begin with a project that is a little less mathematical and more computational, then work up to a more mathematically rigorous project. Another research topic you could explore at Cornell is numerical relativity.

If you find it more worthwhile to spend time taking advanced classes and self-studying rather than doing experimental research, then that may be okay, as you should not force yourself to do experimental work just for the sake of doing it. There have been undergrads at Cornell who have gone directly into theory and have done well without having experience in experimental research. However, at an institution like Cornell, which does have many opportunities for underclassmen to do experimental research, it may not be a bad idea to try it. You can always leave a lab if you do not enjoy the research. Labs are usually understanding and have the expectation that undergrad research is more for the benefit of the undergrad than the group itself.

One caveat is that graduate school applications will require multiple professors to vouch for you. Students who only do theory research may not have as many research PIs who can speak on their behalf, as students often only join theory groups later on in their undergrad career. In this case, it can be a good idea to consider asking a professor who taught a class in which you did well. Given the emphasis on coursework and grades in theory graduate school applications, this may not be a bad idea even if you have multiple research PIs.

Another thing to keep in mind is that getting your foot in the door via experimental research early on can lead to other opportunities. Your PI can advocate for you when it comes to summer opportunities off campus (ex. REU programs), fellowship applications, and even contacting theory professors, which can give you a better chance at joining a theory group than just a cold email.

For your last question, it depends. If you have demonstrated a solid grasp of your coursework and have strong letters from your PIs, it is possible—however, you should make sure that theoretical research is something you truly want to do and clearly lay out your intentions when applying. If you attend an institution with opportunities for undergraduate theory research, then it is highly recommended that you join a group. Though there is a higher barrier to entry, careful planning earlier on and good performances in your courses (which is always helpful) should be sufficient, and most people who are serious about doing theory research are successful in joining groups. You can always reach out to theory professors to ask if they are taking students and what prerequisites there are to joining their groups; many professors are approachable and give useful advice.

Some parting thoughts: it’s great that you are thinking ahead about how to best prepare for this path. The expectations for theory grad school may feel daunting right now, but you will have plenty of time in undergrad to accomplish all of these things. Try out different research groups, talk to professors, and take advanced courses when you are prepared. Finally, try to enjoy your time in college too—the academics can be intense, but the exploration and growth you do outside the classroom can be just as exhilarating and rewarding. Wishing you the best."

"If you have a specific research interest in HEP-th, my recommendation would be to try to optimize your schedule to take prerequisites as early as possible while maintaining good grades and a solid understanding of the foundational ideas. At the same time, prereqs are not enforced, so if you can study the material on your own before taking a higher level class, that should work as long as you learn what’s necessary. In terms of research, getting to a level of comfort with the physics to actually do anything interesting will likely happen towards the end of your undergraduate career, if at all, so it’s a very good idea to get involved in different research before then. The main relevant thing here is that you find something you are interested in, but is still accessible, so you should email professors to find out what they are looking for in a student."

## Course conflicts with PHYS 4410
### Question
I'm planning my path through the Physics curriculum and have some questions about PHYS 4410.

During Fall Semester, PHYS 4410 lecture (2:30-3:20) overlaps with AEP 3560 discussion (1:25-2:40). All AEP seniors are required to take both PHYS 4410 and AEP 3560. Does this constrain AEP seniors to taking PHYS 4410 in the spring semester? If not, how is this contention resolved?

The Cornell Class Roster lists the PHYS 4410 lab portion as meeting from 1:25 to 4:25 on both Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Many other interesting Cornell courses meet either MWF or TR. Blocking off the whole afternoon on two consecutive days needlessly eliminates a slew of interesting courses in other departments. Is my reading of the Roster correct? (I'm hoping the answer is no, you pick one of the two days.)

The Physics department promises to send out a packet explaining PHYS 4410 at the end of spring semester junior year. That's kind of late for planners like me. Can this forum post packets from prior years? I don't see any reason to keep them secret, and it would help with planning.

### Answer
No; many AEP seniors take PHYS 4410 concurrently with AEP 3560. Historically (i.e. in Fall 2024 and presumably in previous years as well), the AEP department has approved this exact conflict, so there is no need to worry about it. I do find it strange that the AEP department _creates_ this conflict in the first place, but that's another story.

The current policy is that you are allowed to have a partial conflict with one of the two lab days, but not both. It is possible to take a course not required for graduation as long as it only conflicts with one of the lab days; the petition may be tricky to get approved depending on which departments are involved, but the physics department usually has no problem with this. Conflicts with the lecture will likely be denied unless they are absolutely necessary for graduation, such as in the case of AEP 3560--and even this is only a partial conflict.

I am not aware of any "information packet" explaining PHYS 4410, but here is the information we have received regarding course enrollment:
- During your junior spring (we received it in early March), you will receive an email from the physics course enrollment staff to indicate whether you will be taking PHYS 4410 in the fall or spring, or whether you will not be taking it at all. This form is first-come, first-served, so monitor your inbox and make sure to remind your friends too.
- The physics department will automatically enroll you in PHYS 4410 before pre-enroll. This includes the lecture and both the Tuesday and Wednesday lab sections. There have been talks about giving students the option to select only one of the lab days on Student Center, but this has not yet been implemented.
- If you plan to take a course that conflicts with one of the lab days, and you expect this course to fill up, you should drop PHYS 4410 and enroll in the other course during pre-enroll. Make sure to email the physics enrollment staff to inform them that you have dropped PHYS 4410 but will re-enroll via petition. Then, during add/drop, you must submit a petition to your college's registrar to re-enroll in PHYS 4410. Note that time conflict forms are only processed during add/drop.

In terms of the course itself, you will be required to attend lectures and weekly pod meetings. Pod meetings are just brief group meetings with one of the course instructors to give progress updates on your lab. Your weekly pod meetings will occur at the beginnning of the lab session on either Tuesdays or Wednesdays (if you have a conflict on e.g. Tuesdays, you will have your pod meetings on Wednesdays). Students are allowed to go into the lab to do work weekdays 8 am - 5 pm, so you will have a lot of flexibility in terms of when you actually do your lab work; the times listed on Student Center are more so suggestions for when you should attend lab, as these are the hours when the course instructors (as well as your peers) will be available to help you.
