# Join Discord and Slack

Below are some chat spaces for physics and AEP students at Cornell. These are great places to meet new people and ask any questions you may have.

## Cornell Math & Physics Discord

The **Cornell Math & Physics Discord** is a platform for Cornell students who are interested in math and physics. It is student-run and has no affiliation with SPS. Please click [this link](https://discord.gg/2yaJsNa4Jz) to join.

To access the other channels within the server, you must first join the Cornell University server (this requires a Cornell NetID) and then request verification in the #introductions channel of the Cornell Math & Physics server.

## Cornell SPS Slack

The **Cornell SPS Slack** is one of Cornell SPS's communication platforms. It is used in conjunction with the SPS email listserv (this is the most reliable place to get information about SPS---please join [here](https://forms.gle/TPY8feDT6bxYrjhW6) if you have not already) to send out updates about SPS events, and members can also use the Slack to chat with others.
