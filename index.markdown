# Welcome to the Cornell Physics Wiki!
{:.no_toc}

This is a resource for courses, research, graduate school, outreach, awards and scholarships, and other opportunities to be involved with physics at Cornell!

If there is anything that you would like to see on the Wiki, please let us know! You can email us or fill out a form in the **[Input and Feedback Forms](/input_feedback/feedback_forms.html)** page.

This website is entirely student-run and managed by the e-board of the Society of Physics Students. While the wiki does include links to official department forms, such as the freshman brochure, senior thesis guidelines, and department website pages, the Physics Department does not have any official involvement in this wiki; we simply aim to share potentially helpful resources from a variety of sources, ranging from student testimonials to department guidelines.

Have any questions? Please visit the **[Questions](/questions.html)** page.
